You are developing a Smart Feedback Analyzer for a Fitness App.
The app collects written feedback from users about:

 Workout programs
 Trainers
 Diet plans
 Mobile app experience

The company wants a basic Java tool to automatically analyze this feedback.

Your Task:

Write a Java program that:

1. Accepts multi-line feedback from the user.
   (Use `"end"` as the keyword to finish input)

2. Splits the feedback into sentences based on punctuation: `.`.

3. For each sentence:

    If it contains positive words like:
     `"good", "great", "awesome", "love", "excellent"`
     → Count it as positive
    If it contains negative words like:
     `"bad", "poor", "hate", "worst", "terrible", "dislike"`
     → Count it as negative
    Otherwise → Count it as neutral

4. At the end, print a summary:

   
   Total Sentences   : X
   Positive Sentences: Y
   Negative Sentences: Z
   Neutral Sentences : W
   



Example Input:


I love this app! The workouts are excellent.
But the diet plan is bad. I hate how slow it loads.
Overall, it's okay. 
end

Expected Output:

Total Sentences   : 4
Positive Sentences: 2
Negative Sentences: 2
Neutral Sentences : 1
