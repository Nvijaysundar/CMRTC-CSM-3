   * If the vehicle type is Truck and hours > 5 → add ₹100 heavy vehicle fee

4. Calculate:

   * Base charge
   * Discount or extra charge (if any)
   * Final charge
   * Print detailed bill for the vehicle

 Features to Use:

* instance variables for each vehicle
* static variables for tracking total vehicles and revenue (optional)
* methods:

  * calculateBaseCharge()
  * applyDiscountOrSurcharge()
  * printBill()
* decision-making using if-else
